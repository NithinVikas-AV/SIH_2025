Let's break it down together.\n\nFirstly, I want you to know that it's completely normal to feel this way, especially when we're surrounded by people who don't share our experiences or backgrounds. It sounds like the geographical and cultural differences between your study location and workplace have created a sense of disconnection for you.\n\nIt's not uncommon for individuals to struggle with feelings of loneliness, even in situations where they might appear to be surrounded by others. Sometimes, it's just about feeling seen, heard, and understood.\n\nNow, let's explore some possible reasons behind these emotions:\n\n1. **Cultural identity**: You mentioned that everyone at your workplace looks different because of the organization's location. This could be making you feel like an outsider, especially if you don't see many people from your own cultural background.\n2. **Fear of being different**: It's possible that you're worried about being perceived as \"different\" or \"out-of-place\" due to your studies or personal circumstances.\n3. **Difficulty in connecting with colleagues**: Maybe you've tried reaching out to your coworkers, but haven't been able to form meaningful connections.\n\nNow, let's try to find some solutions together!\n\nHere are a few suggestions:\n\n1. **Reach out to colleagues**: Take the initiative to get to know your coworkers better. Ask them about their interests, hobbies, or weekends. This can help you build bridges and create friendships.\n2. **Find common ground**: Look for shared experiences or interests that can bring people together. It might be a sports team, a book club, or even a lunch group.\n3. **Talk to someone**: Share your feelings with a trusted friend, family member, or mentor. Sometimes just talking about our emotions can help us process and gain new insights.\n\nLastly, remember that you're not alone in this struggle!

What are some things that you can do right now to help shift your focus away from disappointment and towards something more positive?\n\nFor example, have you talked to your teacher or a trusted adult about what happened? They might be able to offer some guidance or support to help you understand what went wrong.\n\nOr perhaps we could explore some strategies together for how you can move forward and learn from this experience. Maybe there are some areas where you excelled in the exam, or some strengths that you can build upon for future exams.\n\nRemember, it's okay to make mistakes – it's all part of the learning process!

Your sole responsibility is to orchestrate server-side agents exposed as MCP tools (the Mindwell agent on the MCP server) and compose a concise, empathetic final reply. Do not invent facts; do not answer directly without using tools.\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\tTOOLS (Mindwell on MCP Server):\\n\\t\\t- get_medical_response(query: str): Primary tool for guidance on mental/medical queries; also returns helpline information when needed.\\n\\t\\t- counsellor_referral(): Use when the user seems moderately distressed and should be connected to a counsellor.\\n\\t\\t- crisis_alert(reason: str): Use immediately for severe or urgent risk (self-harm, imminent danger, suicidal ideation with plan).\\n\\t\\t- suggest_resource(search_bar: str): Use for non-urgent support like educational/coping resources.\\n\\t\\t- flag_misuse_alert(reason: str): Use if the user appears to misuse/abuse the system.\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\tROUTING POLICY:\\n\\t\\t- Every user turn must invoke at least one MCP tool. Never bypass the server.\\n\\t\\t- Begin by calling get_medical_response with the user's message, unless the content clearly requires flag_misuse_alert or immediate crisis_alert first.\\n\\t\\t- After the primary call, consider secondary tools (counsellor_referral, crisis_alert, suggest_resource, flag_misuse_alert) based on severity and context.\\n\\t\\t- Summarize and present the tool outputs as a single final answer to the user.\\n\\t\\t\\n        HELPLINE POLICY (INDIA-ONLY):\\n\\t\\t- When helplines are relevant, consult Mindwell (via get_medical_response) for helpline details.\\n\\t\\t- If any tool output includes helplines from outside India (UK/US/other), you must replace them in your composed answer with India-only helplines.\\n\\t\\t- Prefer: Tele-MANAS (14416 or 1-800-891-4416), Kiran (1800-599-0019), iCALL (9152987821), Vandrevala (9999666555), Aasra (9820466726), Snehi (9582208181).\\n\\t\\t- If unsure about a country, omit that number and provide only Indian helplines.\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\tGENERAL STYLE:\\n\\t\\t- Assess tone and urgency first; be supportive and clear.\\n\\t\\t- Keep answers brief, with actionable next steps.

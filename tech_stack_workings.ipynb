      "I'm so sorry to hear that you're feeling this way. It's completely understandable to feel overwhelmed by the challenges of PCOD, and it's heartbreaking to experience stigma and judgment from others.\n",

      "Firstly, please know that you are not alone in feeling this way. Many people have been through similar experiences, and there is hope for a better tomorrow. Let's focus on some steps we can take together to help you feel more supported and empowered:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Allow yourself to feel your emotions**: It's essential to acknowledge and validate your feelings, rather than trying to suppress them. Permit yourself to grieve the losses you've experienced due to PCOD, and allow yourself to feel sad or angry.\n",
      "2. **Practice self-compassion**: Be kind to yourself, just as you would a close friend. Treat yourself with understanding, patience, and support. Remind yourself that it's okay to not be okay right now.\n",
      "3. **Focus on what you can control**: Instead of dwelling on the negative comments or judgments from others, focus on what you can control – your thoughts, emotions, and actions. You have the power to choose how you respond to situations.\n",
      "4. **Surround yourself with positive influences**: Spend time with people who uplift and support you. Reach out to friends, family members, or online communities that share similar experiences and offer encouragement.\n",
      "5. **Practice self-care**: Engage in activities that bring you joy and relaxation. Whether it's reading, walking, painting, or cooking, make time for hobbies that help you feel more grounded and fulfilled.\n",
      "6. **Reframe your thinking**: Challenge negative thoughts by reframing them in a more positive light. For example, instead of thinking \"I'm so worthless because I look stout,\" try reframing it as \"I have PCOD, but I'm working on managing it, and I'm strong for facing this challenge.\"\n",
      "7. **Find supportive online resources**: There are many online communities and forums dedicated to supporting women with PCOD and body image issues. You might find solace in sharing your experiences and connecting with others who understand what you're going through.\n",
      "8. **Reach out for professional help**: If you're struggling to cope with feelings of low self-worth, anxiety, or depression, consider reaching out to a mental health professional for support.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember, you are more than your physical appearance or medical condition. You are a unique and valuable individual with worth, love, and deservingness of happiness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Keep in mind that it's okay to take things one step at a time. We'll work together to build a plan that suits your needs and helps you feel more confident and empowered.\n",

      "3.  **Self-care**: Engage in activities that bring you comfort and joy. This could be anything from reading, listening to soothing music, taking long walks, or practicing yoga. Make time for yourself each day to recharge.\n",
      "4.  **Positive affirmations**: Repeat affirmations like \"I am loved,\" \"I am worthy of love and respect,\" or \"I am enough.\" These statements can help counteract negative thoughts and boost your self-esteem.\n",
      "5.  **Mindfulness exercises**: Practice mindfulness techniques, such as meditation or deep breathing exercises, to calm your mind and body.\n",
